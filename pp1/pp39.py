#Polymorphysm = Greek word that means to  "have many forms of faces"
#               poly - many
#               morphe - form

#               there are 2 ways to achieve the polymorphism
#               1. Inheritance - an object can be treated of the same type as a parent class
#               2. "Duck typing" - Object must have necessary attributes/methods
